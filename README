This library was written over the span of several hours very, very early in
the morning while hopped up on half a dozen cans of Red Bull. It has worked
perfectly on the limited amount of test data I've put through it, but it may
be full of hidden and horrible bugs.

It was written just to solve a single problem, and is far from optimal software
in many ways (architecture, efficiency, etc), but should get the job done.

It's also entirely uncommented and undocumented, but the couple of sample
files should get you started.

The library only implements 'nice' read/write methods for a select few types
(see the `tlv` folder). Anything else you will need to either implement a
type for, or pack/unpack the data when calling get/set on the TLV.

Good luck.
